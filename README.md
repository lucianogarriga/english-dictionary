## **JAVASCRIPT DOCS** - DOM - fetch - API - async - await

<br>

To give functionality to the input, first we get everything inside the input.


1) We must create a function fetchAPI.  
In params, it receive the word that the user will give.

```js
    function fetchAPI(word){
```
2) We create a const which takes the url.
```js
    const url = `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/${word}`;
    
```
3) We can request from the API, so we can have the result.  
We create a const and we call it result
```js 
    const result;
    //fetch(url) => after the fetching we want to wait for the response (res)
    const result = fetch(url).then((res));
    //we get the response and we want to convert this response to a JSON file with a Js method
    const result = fetch(url).then((res)=>res.json());
```
4) Always have to use **AWAIT** when we are **fetching data from API**.  
```js
    const result = await fetch(url).then((res)=>res.json());
```
5) And then, we need to change the function from normal to **ASYNC** function

```js
    async function fetchAPI(word){
        const url = `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/${word}`;

        const result = await fetch(url).then((res)=>res.json());

        console.log(result);
    }
```

### TRY-CATCH

Another things we need to do when we are fetching data => Use Try and Catch a statement.

```js
    try {
        
    } catch (error) {
        
    }
```

**TRY-CATCH helps to get the possible errors from the API request**  
<br>
We need to cut everything and put it inside the try

```js
    try {
        const url = `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/${word}`;
        const result = await fetch(url).then((res)=>res.json());
        console.log(result);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
    }
```
If an error happens => this try-catch it gets the error and show it.

## INNERTEXT

I want to change the inner text of 'info-text' ID. 

```js
    infoTextEl.innerText = `Searching the meaning of "${word}"`;
```
After the results comes, we set the display of this info text element to **NONE**.

```js
        infoTextEl.style.display = "none"
```
Then, we need to bring it back to the nromal display when we are requesting again.
So we put it before the request, and we change the display to block there.

```js
        infoTextEl.style.display = "block";
```


<br> 

## EVENT LISTENER - KEYUP - fetchAPI  
<br>

1) We take the HTML element by ID 
```js
    // getElementById = "input" / and store it in const
    const inputEl = document.getElementById("input");
```
2) Add an event listener to get everything inside the input
```js
    inputEl.addEventListener("keyup", (e)=>{
        if(e.target.value && e.key === "Enter"){
            fetchAPI(e.target.value)
        };
    })
```
